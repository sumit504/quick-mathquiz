### Configuration

```javascript
// Reown Project ID
const REOWN_PROJECT_ID = 'e0dd881bad824ac3418617434a79f917';

// Reown AppKit initialization
const appKitModal = createAppKit({ 
    adapters: [new EthersAdapter()], 
    projectId: REOWN_PROJECT_ID, 
    networks: [base], 
    metadata: { 
        name: 'Quick Math',

- getRemainingClaimsForFID(uint256 farcasterFID)
- getContractBalance()
- getRewardAmount()
```

    transports: {
        [base.id]: http()
    }
});

// Reown configuration (Standalone mode)

});
```

## üì± Farcaster Frame Configuration

The game includes Farcaster Mini App metadata:

```json
{
    "version": "1",
    "imageUrl": "https://quick-mathquiz.vercel.app/image.png",
    "button": {
        "title": "Play Quick Math & Earn!",
        "action": {
            "type": "launch_frame",
            "name": "Quick Math",
            "url": "https://quick-mathquiz-tau.vercel.app",
            "splashImageUrl": "https://quick-mathquiz.vercel.app/splash.png",
            "splashBackgroundColor": "#cce5ff"
        }
    }
}
```

## üé® Game Mechanics

### Question Types
- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b` (always positive results)
- Multiplication: `a √ó b`

### Answer Generation
- One correct answer
- Three incorrect but plausible distractors
- Randomized positions for each question
- 6-second falling animation

### Scoring
- Time starts on first question load
- Stops when 4th question answered correctly
- Time displayed in seconds with 2 decimal places
- Only best times saved to leaderboard

## üîê Security Features

- Transaction confirmations required for all blockchain actions
- User rejection handling for wallet transactions
- Score validation on smart contract
- Daily claim limits per Farcaster ID
- Balance checks before reward distribution
- Reown secure connection protocols
- Network verification (Base only)

## üéµ Audio Assets

Required audio files in `/sounds/` directory:
- `correct.mp3`: Played on correct answer
- `wrong.mp3`: Played on incorrect answer
- `win.mp3`: Played on game completion

## üìä Player Statistics

The contract tracks:
- Best completion time
- Total games played
- Total rewards claimed
- Last play timestamp

## üåê Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Environment Detection
The game automatically detects whether it's running:
- **Inside Farcaster**: Uses native wallet connector and profile data
- **Standalone**: Uses Reown AppKit for wallet connection

### Wallet Provider Handling
```javascript
// Automatic detection
async function detectEnvironment() {
    try {
        const context = await sdk.context;
        if (context?.user?.fid) {
            isFarcasterEnvironment = true;
            // Use Farcaster wallet
        }
    } catch (error) {
        isFarcasterEnvironment = false;
        // Use Reown AppKit
    }
}
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

- Requires Base network connectivity
- Audio may not autoplay on some browsers
- Leaderboard limited to top 50 players
- One reward claim per 24 hours per FID
- Reown modal requires user action to connect
